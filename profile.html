                <p>Name: Novrelya Clara Sidik</p>
                <p>Position: Founder, President & Chief of Operations</p>
                <p>An aspiring future Computer Science student, Novy is thrilled to have <i>studybliss</i> as her first step 
                    into web development. Her diligent nature and persevering attitude has always got her exerting her 
                    best into everything she’s passionate about. It might seem odd if she says that Math might be one of 
                    her favorite subjects, but she believes the complexity of a problem is worth the time she takes to 
                    solve and understand it. Not to mention her undying love for literature. Analyzing implicit meanings 
                    of beautifully woven texts might be her main source of adrenaline. Through her summer holidays, she 
                    had built this website from literally scratch, while relying on a 6-hour Youtube video as her source 
                    of knowledge. She hopes that <i>studybliss</i> can help students globally in reviewing for their standardized 
                    exams, both in an easier and more comfortable manner.

                    everyday language despite being a proud business student since the beginning of her IGCSE journey, she is an 
                    enthusiastic, kind and hard-working student that is continuously striving to be a better version of herself 
                    each & every day. Always inclined to helping others whether it be in academics or their social life, Rychelle

                    is just what Anjarico needs after a long day of work, i luv fried rice ^-^); likewise his longing to serve the

                    simply be a blessing for others. With <i>studybliss</i> ready for action, we hope this may bless and prove useful to

                    is an academically-gifted (though everyone has their own weaknesses) sophomore student

                    you’ve known her for 5 years or 5 seconds, she’ll treat you like a friend immediately and 
                    call you “bro” — she’s very thankful for the opportunity to work alongside her seniors in 
                    <i>studybliss</i>! She puts all her heart into all works and pieces, regardless of whether it's a 
                    school task, extracurriculars, or even personal projects. With this, she looks forward to
