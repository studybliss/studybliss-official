                <p>Position: Founder, President, Chief of Operations & Academic Patron</p>
                <p>An aspiring future Computer Science student, Novy is thrilled to have <i>studybliss</i> as her first step 
                    into web development. Her diligent nature and persevering attitude has always got her exerting her 
                    best into everything she’s passionate about. It might seem odd if she says that Math might be one of 
                    her favorite subjects, but she believes the complexity of a problem is worth the time she takes to 
                    solve and understand it. Not to mention her undying love for literature. Analyzing implicit meanings 
                    of beautifully woven texts might be her main source of adrenaline. Through her summer holidays, she 
                    had built this website from literally scratch, while relying on a 6-hour Youtube video as her source 
                    of knowledge. She hopes that <i>studybliss</i> can help students globally in reviewing for their standardized 
                    exams, both in an easier and more comfortable manner.

                <p>Position: Academic Patron</p>
                <p>Meet Anjaly, the academic patron of Group 3 Business Management. Yes, she started as an 
                    IGCSE science student, but she randomly switched paths in IB because that’s just how she 
                    rolls. She can be the quietest girl in the room or the noisiest—depends on her mood. But 
                    one thing's for sure, do not disturb her during exam weeks unless you're ready to wake a 
                    lion. Despite her fierceness, Anjaly cries at the smallest things—like seeing an elderly 
                    person alone, scoring below 90, or even just hearing someone say they’re proud of her. 
                    But when it comes to chasing her dreams, she’s relentless. She’d do anything to get into 
                    her dream university. Sure, she procrastinates sometimes, but when deadlines hit, she always 
                    finds a way to get it done. When she’s not in bed, crying at her desk, or live on TikTok, 
                    you’ll find her munching on her favorite ice cream.

                <p>Celine Auriell, a junior who just freshly retired IGCSE is thrilled to be apart of <i>studybliss</i>! 
                    With her perseverance and colorful summary notes (that she's anticipating to share), she was able
                    to perform well throughout her sophomore year and the IGCSE assessment. Although she has only been in 
                    BTB since freshmen, it didn't take her long to adapt as her sparkling and lovely persona never fails 
                    to cheer everyone up. Speaking about cheering people up, watching dramas, listening to SVT, and 
                    eating a spoonful of ice cream are the little activities that never fail to raise her spirit! 
                    Celine is filled with gratitude for this opportunity and hopes that she can assist different learners 
                    around the globe.

                <p>Aiko is excited to have <i>studybliss</i> as a stepping stone towards her goal. 
                    Balancing study and ambition, Aiko has many hobbies and likes to try new stuff 
                    (not food), and she is a bit competitive. However, this young girl likes to procrastinate 
                    every 20 minutes during an intense study period. However, she usually meets her deadlines 
                    by trying hard to finish it or using ChatGPT :D. Through StudyBliss, she hopes to enhance her 
                    skills, and inspire others and looks forward to using this experience to prepare for the 
                    future, where she aims to make a lasting impact in the world.

                <p>Position: Academic Patron</p>
                <p>Despite being carefree and not particularly studious, Edward is a remarkably well-accomplished
                    student. Having excelled in his IGCSEs and securing gold in multiple Math Olympiads, Edward 
                    possesses an innate aptitude for critical thinking and is often seen as a human calculator 
                    (though we lovingly call him a nerd for that). Some people believe he subconsciously 
                    calculates the surface area of objects around him, while others humorously suggest he has 
                    the brain of a genius in disguise. Beyond academics, Edward is passionate about photography 
                    and photo editing, finding both creativity and tranquility through the lens of his camera. 
                    While he generally projects a calm and composed demeanor, his vibrant and energetic side 
                    emerges when he's surrounded by close friends, where his true enthusiasm flourishes. With 
                    his unwavering determination, Edward aims to contribute to <i>studybliss</i> in helping more 
                    students excel on their academic paths.

                <p>Avid cat lover, devoted plants and Pokémon collector are solely synonyms of <i>studybliss'</i> 
                    new academic patron, Giselle Aretha Putri. When she's not playing Adopt Me, you can 
                    find her passionately watching Adventure Time or stealing her friend's Indomie. Although 
                    she devoted most of her time to watching IG Reels instead of studying for her IGCSEs, 
                    she was still able to perform well on the exams and got great results. She's just as 
                    determined to work hard for <i>studybliss</i> just like for her dreams to be a zoologist. She's 
                    thankful to be apart of <i>studybliss</i> and hopes it can be a pioneer for many students around the world.
