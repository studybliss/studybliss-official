                <p>Name: Novrelya Clara Sidik</p>
                <p>Position: Founder, President & Chief of Operations</p>
                <p>An aspiring future Computer Science student, Novy is thrilled to have <i>studybliss</i> as her first step 
                    into web development. Her diligent nature and persevering attitude has always got her exerting her 
                    best into everything sheâ€™s passionate about. It might seem odd if she says that Math might be one of 
                    her favorite subjects, but she believes the complexity of a problem is worth the time she takes to 
                    solve and understand it. Not to mention her undying love for literature. Analyzing implicit meanings 
                    of beautifully woven texts might be her main source of adrenaline. Through her summer holidays, she 
                    had built this website from literally scratch, while relying on a 6-hour Youtube video as her source 
                    of knowledge. She hopes that <i>studybliss</i> can help students globally in reviewing for their standardized 
                    exams, both in an easier and more comfortable manner.

                <p>In a world filled with opportunities, Rychelle has been a versatile learner since she was a young girl, filled 
                    with a large variety of talents and interests. Often mistaken for a science student because of her perfect 
                    score streak during her final year of taking the subject as well as the random usage of scientific terms in 
                    everyday language despite being a proud business student since the beginning of her IGCSE journey, she is an 
                    enthusiastic, kind and hard-working student that is continuously striving to be a better version of herself 
                    each & every day. Always inclined to helping others whether it be in academics or their social life, Rychelle 
                    is hoping that <i>studybliss</i> will be able to directly help many young individuals all around the globe achieve 
                    their desired grades and make studying for the standardized exams less stressful.

                <p>Hear ye! Hear ye! If you are surprised to see his face here then you are not alone. Praise be to God that He has 
                    yet again opened a door to Anjarico here, an opportunity he could have never even imagined. For as high as the 
                    skies are above the earth, so is his love for fried rice, (steaming freshly-cooked fried rice over a hot wok 
                    is just what Anjarico needs after a long day of work, i luv fried rice ^-^); likewise his longing to serve the 
                    community and to give back to society to make it a better place; accommodating with his life-long mission to 
                    simply be a blessing for others. With <i>studybliss</i> ready for action, we hope this may bless and prove useful to 
                    many students internationally. <i>Bon Voyage</i>!
